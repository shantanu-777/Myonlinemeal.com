This repository contains the final minor project I completed during my web development internship at Skill Vertex. 
The project, titled onlinemeal.com, is a basic frontend application, designed using HTML and CSS. 
The aim was to replicate the core features of a food delivery platform, focusing on UI/UX design principles and responsive layouts.
